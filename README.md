### Smart Job Application Tracking Web Application

👋 Welcome to SmartApply!

SmartApply is a modern, full-stack web application designed to help job seekers track applications, monitor interview progress, manage follow-ups, and analyze job search outcomes — all from a single, clean dashboard.

This project was built using Vibe Coding, where the entire application was developed rapidly by describing features in plain English and refining them iteratively with AI assistance.
The goal is to demonstrate how real-world, production-style applications can be built quickly without compromising UI, structure, or usability.

📄 Track job applications with detailed status.

📊 Visual analytics for interviews, offers, and rejections.

⏰ Follow-up reminders to never miss deadlines.

🌍 Visa sponsorship tracking for international candidates.

▶️ This project shows how complex workflow-driven applications can be created cleanly using natural language instructions.

## 🎯 Why This Project?

I built SmartApply to solve a real problem faced by job seekers, especially those applying to multiple roles across companies and locations.

This project demonstrates:

- Real-world job application workflow modeling
- Building data-driven dashboards from user inputs
- Tracking application lifecycle states (Applied → Interview → Offer/Rejected)
- Managing follow-ups and deadlines
- Supporting visa sponsorship tracking, which is critical for international candidates
- Rapid full-stack development using Vibe Coding
It also serves as a strong portfolio-quality project that reflects production-ready thinking.
