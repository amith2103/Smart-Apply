Build a full-stack web application called “Smart Apply” — a Job Application Tracker with analytics and visa sponsorship tracking.

Goal:
Help users track job applications, follow-ups, interviews, and visa sponsorship availability using a clean dashboard with real data and charts. This should be portfolio-ready and easy to demo on LinkedIn/GitHub.

Tech stack (must use):
- Frontend: React + TypeScript
- Styling: Tailwind CSS (or existing UI system in the template)
- Backend: Node.js + Express (or existing server folder structure)
- Database: persistent storage using the project’s existing DB/ORM approach
- Charts: Recharts (Pie chart + Bar chart)
- Data fetching: React Query (if already used)

Core Data Model (Job Application):
Each job application must store:
- id
- companyName (string)
- jobTitle (string)
- location (string; optional)
- jobLink (string; optional)
- dateApplied (date)
- status (enum): Applied, Interviewing, Offer, Rejected
- priority (enum): Low, Medium, High (optional but recommended)
- salaryRange (string; optional)
- notes (string; optional)

Visa Sponsorship Tracking Fields (required):
- sponsorshipStatus (enum): Not needed, Required, Offered, Not offered, Unknown
- workAuthorization (enum): H1B, OPT, CPT, F1, Green Card, Citizen, Other
- sponsorshipNotes (string; optional)

Follow-up Tracking:
- followUpDate (date; optional)
- followUpDone (boolean; optional)
- A job should be marked “Overdue” in UI if followUpDate is in the past and followUpDone is false.

Pages / Routes:
1) Dashboard (/)
- Summary cards:
  - Total applications
  - Interviews count
  - Offers count
  - Rejections count
  - Sponsorship Offered count
  - Overdue follow-ups count
- Charts (must use real stored data):
  - Pie chart: application status distribution (Applied/Interviewing/Offer/Rejected)
  - Pie chart OR stacked bar: sponsorshipStatus distribution (Offered/Not offered/Unknown/Required/Not needed)
  - Bar chart: applications per week (last 8 weeks) OR per month (last 6 months)
- A “Today / This Week” section showing applications that need follow-up soon (next 7 days) and those overdue.

2) Applications (/applications)
- List all applications with:
  - company name, job title, status, date applied
  - sponsorship badge (Offered / Not offered / Unknown / Required / Not needed)
  - follow-up badge (Overdue / Due soon / None)
- Filters:
  - status
  - sponsorshipStatus
  - workAuthorization
  - date range (applied dates)
  - search by company/job title
- Sorting:
  - newest applied
  - follow-up date
  - priority

3) Add/Edit Application (/applications/new, /applications/:id/edit)
- Form fields for all model attributes.
- Keep UX clean:
  - Put sponsorship fields under an “Additional Details” collapsible section.
- Validation:
  - companyName, jobTitle, status, dateApplied required
  - safe handling for optional fields
- Edit should update an existing job.

4) Follow-ups (/followups) (optional but recommended)
- Show a focused list of:
  - Overdue follow-ups
  - Due in next 7 days
- One-click “Mark Follow-up Done”

Backend API Requirements (real data, no mocks):
Implement REST endpoints (exact names can vary but must support these actions):
- GET /api/applications (supports filters: status, sponsorshipStatus, workAuthorization, search, date range, sorting)
- POST /api/applications (create)
- GET /api/applications/:id (read)
- PUT /api/applications/:id (update)
- DELETE /api/applications/:id (delete)
- GET /api/analytics/dashboard (returns aggregated counts + chart-ready arrays)

Analytics endpoint must return:
- counts:
  totalApplications, interviewsCount, offersCount, rejectionsCount,
  sponsorshipOfferedCount, overdueFollowUpsCount
- chart datasets:
  statusBreakdown: [{ name, value }]
  sponsorshipBreakdown: [{ name, value }]
  applicationsTrend: [{ periodLabel, count }]  // week or month

Frontend Requirements:
- Use React Query to fetch:
  - applications list with filters
  - dashboard analytics
- Charts must update based on current filters when applicable.
- Use reusable components for cards, badges, and tables.
- Add nice UI details:
  - rounded buttons, hover effects, consistent spacing, responsive design
  - status chips for Applied/Interviewing/Offer/Rejected
  - sponsorship chips for Offered/Not offered/Unknown/etc.

Non-Goals (important constraints):
- Do not add authentication/login for MVP.
- Do not use mock/demo chart values. All charts must come from stored DB data.
- Keep the code organized and readable.
- Ensure app works on refresh and data persists.

Deliverables:
- Implement the full working app with all pages and APIs
- Provide clean folder structure (client/server/shared if template uses it)
- Add a README.md that explains:
  features, tech stack, screenshots section, how to run locally, vibe coding note

Success Criteria:
- User can add job applications in < 30 seconds
- Dashboard charts reflect real data immediately
- Filters work for status and visa sponsorship fields
- Follow-up tracking shows overdue and due-soon items clearly
