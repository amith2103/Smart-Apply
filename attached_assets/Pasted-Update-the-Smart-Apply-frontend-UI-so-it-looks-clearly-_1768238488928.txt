Update the Smart Apply frontend UI so it looks clearly different from my previous LifeTracker project, and fix these UX issues:

A) NEW UI LOOK (must look different)
- Change the overall layout style (new header/sidebar style, spacing, typography, card style).
- Use a new color theme (do NOT reuse the same purple/gradients as LifeTracker).
- Make the dashboard look more “career / professional”:
  - Replace playful styling with clean, recruiter-friendly styling.
  - Use consistent card borders, subtle shadows, and clean spacing.
- Keep functionality the same, only redesign UI components and styling.

B) FIX CHART CONTAINERS / BORDERS ALIGNMENT
- On the dashboard, the chart cards (“Application Status” and “Applications Trend”) should have aligned borders and equal padding.
- Remove weird thick borders and ensure all cards have the same border radius + consistent spacing.
- Ensure charts are centered and legends do not overflow outside the card.

C) MAKE STAT CARDS CLICKABLE (IMPORTANT)
Currently clicking Total Applications / Interviews / Offers does nothing.
Implement this behavior:
- Clicking “Total Applications” navigates to /applications with no filter (shows all).
- Clicking “Interviews” navigates to /applications?status=Interviewing
- Clicking “Offers” navigates to /applications?status=Offer
- Add a “Rejected” stat card on dashboard too (if not present) and clicking it opens /applications?status=Rejected
- On the Applications page:
  - Read query parameters (status, sponsorshipStatus, search, etc.)
  - Pre-apply filters based on the query param
  - Show the filtered results automatically.

D) FIX ADD APPLICATION FORM (FULL PAGE, NOT CORNER MODAL)
Currently the add application form pops up as a small modal in the bottom corner.
Change it to a dedicated full page route:
- /applications/new should render the form as a full-page layout, not a modal.
- /applications/:id/edit should also be a full-page form.
- The “Add Application” button in sidebar should go to /applications/new.
- The form should have:
  - Two-column layout on desktop, single column on mobile
  - Clear section headings:
    - Basic Details
    - Job Details
    - Follow-up
    - Visa & Sponsorship (collapsible section)
  - Sticky header with Save + Cancel buttons at the top
- After saving:
  - Redirect to /applications and show a success toast

Constraints:
- Do not break backend APIs.
- Do not use mock data.
- Keep existing database + routes.
- Only modify frontend and routing behavior unless absolutely required.
- Ensure the UI is responsive.

Deliverables:
- Updated Dashboard UI with clickable stat cards.
- Applications page supports query param filtering.
- Add/Edit application uses full-page form routes.
- Chart containers and borders aligned and clean.
